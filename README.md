Simple discord bot to repeat events, based on the official discord tutorial so some stuff from that is still in there.

Whenever an event is started, the bot checks if the description includes specific words like 
- `:daily:`
- `:weekly:`
- `:monthly:` 

If it does, the bot creates an identical event one day, week, or month later.

To use just put the keyword somewhere in the event description and make sure to actually start the event.
